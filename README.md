Print Patch Warning!

Docs coming soon!

Example usage:

Sometimes in Ruby, it's necessary to backport things like security fixes and stability patches to earlier versions, because upgrading a large-scale ecosystem in ruby can require many months of testing, bug fixes, partial rollouts, etc. Occasionally, you need a way to apply newer fixes to older Ruby runtimes.

But, as often happens, large scale ecosystems tend to collect dust, and hide secrets. Todays quick thinking patch could be tomorrows unexpected production issue, because lets face it - you're going to forget you ever did this in 6 months.


The first, uses a Warning, printed every time your application starts, when the patch is loaded. If your defined Ruby Version and Patch level are equal to or older than the version of Ruby you're running the application with, you'll receive a Warning.

```ruby
print_patch_warning :version => '1.9.3', patch=> 448, :message => "It's time to remove me, as you've upgraded to a version of ruby where this could is no longer needed"

#Dirty hack that is considered a bold move
```

The second, allows you to pass the patch into print_patch_warning as a block, only to be executed if the defined version / patch level of Ruby is not equal to or higher than the Ruby Version the application is running with.

```ruby
print_patch_warning :version => '1.9.3', patch=> 448 do
  #World saving code
end
```

You can also combine the two, and have the patch execute only if ruby is beneath it's defined version, and have the message emitted as a Warning as well

```ruby
print_patch_warning :version => '1.9.3', patch=> 448, :message => "It's time to remove me, as you've upgraded to a version of ruby where this could is no longer needed" do
  #There will be much scorn and derision when this bites someone in the ass
end
```
